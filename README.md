# scrollwheel
Basic scroll-wheel functionality for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey). (Currently GLFW3 only)

This repository does not house one of [my formal modules](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/modules), this is only here for demonstrative purposes. This is a rough implementation meant as an example.

The code found in this repository may be refactored into one of my other modules at a later date. Do not expect proper support for this module.
